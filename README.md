## Open Roleplay
An unique roleplay experience based on San Andreas Multiplayer.

## Compiling
- Open project folder in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).
- Modify `ORP.pwn` from `gamemodes` folder.
- Press `CTRL+SHIFT+B` to compile the scripts.

> To add required files for the [compiler](https://github.com/pawn-lang/compiler) like `.inc` files put them into `include` folder in `compiler` folder.

## Why SA-MP and NOT Open.mp?
We may use our own server and client side improvements and that's why we prefer SA-MP over Open.mp, and that doesn't mean we don't like the [Open.mp](https://github.com/openmultiplayer) project.
